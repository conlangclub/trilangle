    The Trilangle Vocabulary Extension is an optional vocabulary created specifically for Trilangle that can be used in lieu of borrowing another language's vocabulary.

    <h3>Phonology and Orthography</h3>
    <p class="lead">Lexical items in the vocabulary have a (C)V(C) syllable structure and are written using the following symbols from a few different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Aboriginal_syllabics">Canadian Aboriginal syllabaries</a>.</p>

    <p>These symbols work the same way in the Trilangle vocabulary as they do in their original usage: for each syllable in the word, a symbol representing the onset is chosen from the table below, and its orientation depends on the vowel. If the syllable has a coda, the coda symbol is added to the end. <span class="text-muted">(For example, the syllable /ka/ is written &lt;ᑲ&gt;, while /kan/ is written &lt;ᑲᐣ&gt;)</span></p>

        <li>The symbol for the coda /-m/ has been replaced by <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%92%BE">Canadian Syllabics Athabascan M</a> for reasons described in the Phonosemantics section.</li>
        <li>
          The non-coda symbols are from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_syllabics">Carrier syllabary</a>. The vowels represented by orientation are different in Carrier; they have been changed for Trilangle to be more similar to the original Canadian syllabics.
        </li>
        <li>
          The non-coda symbols originally represented the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_syllabics">Carrier syllabary</a> /tʼ/ series. The /t/ series from the original Canadian syllabics were not included due to similarities to logical and set theory symbols. In Trilangle, /tʼ/ and /t/ are in free variation.
