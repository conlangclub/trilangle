  <h2>The vocabulary extension</h2>
  <p class="lead">
    The Trilangle Vocabulary Extension is an optional vocabulary created specifically for Trilangle that can be used in lieu of borrowing another language's vocabulary.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is an extension, meaning a Trilangle sentence that does not use the Trilangle extended vocabulary is still a Trilangle sentence.

    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <h4>Look good with Trilangle</h4>
    <p>The aesthetics of the orthography should fit in well the geometric nature of Trilangle.</p>

    <h4>Have simple rules</h4>
    <p>Phonological and morphological rules should be small in number and simple to describe and execute.</p>

    <h3>Phonology and Orthography</h3>
    <p class="lead">Lexical items in the vocabulary have a (C)V(C) syllable structure and are written using the following symbols from a few different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Aboriginal_syllabics">Canadian Aboriginal syllabaries</a>.</p>

    <p>These symbols work the same way in the Trilangle vocabulary as they do in their original usage: for each syllable in the word, a symbol representing the onset is chosen from the table below, and its orientation depends on the vowel. If the syllable has a coda, the coda symbol is added to the end. <span class="text-muted">(For example, the syllable /ka/ is written &lt;ᑲ&gt;, while /kan/ is written &lt;ᑲᐣ&gt;)</span></p>

          The symbol for the coda /-m/ has been replaced by <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%92%BE">Canadian Syllabics Athabascan M</a> for reasons described in the Morphology section.
        </li>
        <li>
          The non-coda symbols are from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_syllabics">Carrier syllabary</a>. The vowels represented by orientation are different in Carrier; they have been changed for Trilangle to be more similar to the original Canadian syllabics.
        </li>
        <li>
          The non-coda symbols originally represented the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_syllabics">Carrier syllabary</a> /tʼ/ series. The /t/ series from the original Canadian syllabics were not included due to similarities to logical and set theory symbols. In Trilangle, /tʼ/ and /t/ are in free variation.

    <p class="lead">
      There are a small number of syllables used for logical symbols and functional morphemes that cannot exist in the lexicon:

      <ul>
        <li>ᓓ /le/ - Logical not</li>
        <li>ᕈ /ro/ - Logical unknown</li>
        <li>ᐱ /pi/ - Logical and</li>
        <li>ᐯ /pe/ - Logical or</li>
        <li>ᗄ /ɣu~gu/ - Universal quantifier "all"</li>
        <li>ᗱ /ge/ - Existential quantifier "every"</li>
        <li>＝ /θe/ - Equals</li>
        <li>ᑕ /ta/ - Subset</li>

    <h3>Morphology</h3>

    <section>
      <h4>Variables</h4>
      <p class="lead">Any word consisting of a monosyllable that would be allowed in a lexical item is a variable name.</p>
      
      <h4>Negation</h4>
      <p class="lead">Lexical items may be prefixed with ᓓ /le/ to form its negation.</p>
      <p>For example, given the word ᑯᐃ /koi/ <i>love</i>, when given this prefix becomes ᓓᑯᐃ /lekoi/ <i>not love</i>.</p>
      <p>This symbol was chosen due to a resemblance to the logical not symbol (¬).</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h4>Unknowns</h4>
      <p class="lead">Lexical items may be prefixed with ᕈ /ro/ to form its uncertain version.</p>
      <p>For example, given the word ᑯᐃ /koi/ <i>love</i>, when given this prefix becomes ᕈᑯᐃ /rokoi/ <i>maybe love</i>.</p>
      <p>This symbol was chosen due to a resemblance to the question mark (?).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h4>n-place predicates</h4>
      <p class="lead">In the Trilangle vocabulary, the 1-place predicates never end with a consonant, while 2-place predicates always end with ᒾ /m/ and 3-place predicates with ᕑ /r/.</p>

      <p>Each predicate may have other semantically related predicates with different numbers of arguments (arity). For example, the 1-place predicate "love(x)"" asserting <i>the concept of love</i> and the 3-place predicate "love(e, x, y)" asserting that there is an event of something loving something else.</p>

      <p>For example, ᑯᐃ /koi/ <i>love</i> is 1-place and therefore does not end with a consonant, but the 3-place predicate ᑯᐃᕑ /koir/ <i>to love</i> ends with the consonant ᕑ /r/.</p>

      <p>These symbols were chosen due to a resemblance to the arabic numerals 2 and 3.</p>

      <p>Not every n-place predicate has counterparts with different arity.</p>
