    <h3>What is a Possible World?</h3>
    <p class="lead">Any fully-connected and consistent way the world could be, including the one you live in and hypothetical scenarios, is a possible world.</p>

    <p>Consider a hypothetical parallel universe where life evolved differently and there are unicorns. While unicorns don't exist in <em>your</em> world, they exist in this <em>possible</em> world. Your world and this other possible world aren't connected in space or time, so they're considered distinct worlds.</p>

    <p>An object or event is considered part of a possible world if it is connected to the space or time the possible world takes up. For example, you are part of your own possible world because you are connected in space (and time) to the rest of the universe. The idea of Christmas, while taking up an unknown amount of space, does exist in time and is also part of your possible world.</p>

    <p>Objects and events from one possible world can have a counterpart in a different possible world. For example, in a possible world where you are the Prime Minister of Canada, your <i>real-world self</i> is the real-world counterpart of the <i>Prime Minister version of you</i> and vice versa.</p>

    <h3>Sentences</h3>
    <p class="lead">A Trilangle sentence is a contiguous set of triangles connected by edges or vertices. Each Trilangle sentence belongs to a possible world.</p>

    <p>Whether a sentence belongs to the real world or one of various hypothetical possible worlds is pragmatically determined.</p>

    <p>A Green can be used to index counterparts of objects and events in other possible worlds. Combined with negative or unknown polarity, this is useful for counterfactual sentences involving Blues like <i>think, believe,</i> or <i>wish</i>.</p>
