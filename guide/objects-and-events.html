    <h3>Objects</h3>
    <p class="lead">Objects are sets of points in spacetime.</p>

    <p>Apples, tables, dogs, cats, and people all exist in spacetime. Physical objects that have rigid spacetime boundaries can be easily modelled as sets of spacetime coordinates that look like (x,&nbsp;y,&nbsp;z,&nbsp;t), where x, y, and z are points in 3D space, and t is some point in time.</p>

    <p>Abstract objects like <i>the color green, the concept of Christmas,</i> and functional characters like <i>Sherlock Holmes</i> however do not occupy any particular space. In this case, we still say they are sets of spacetime coordinates, except the space components x, y, z are <i>unknown.</i> They still exist in time, so Sherlock Holmes for example is a set of spacetime points spanning from 1887 (or whenever Arthur Conan Doyle first imagined Sherlock Holmes) to the end of time.</p>

    <h3>When objects are equal</h3>
    <p class="lead">If two objects have the exact same set of spacetime points, they are the same object.</p>

    <p class="lead">For objects that have points with components that are unknown, whether or not they are equal is also unknown.</p>

    <p>Imagine if there were two fruits hidden in boxes and you don't know which fruits they are. You know they are both fruits, but you won't know if they are the same type of fruit until you open the boxes. Similarly, if you are given two sets of spacetime points which contain unknown components, you cannot actually tell if they are equal sets.</p>

    <p class="lead">Only objects without unknowns and occupy contiguous regions of spacetime can be considered events.</p>
