    <h3>Review</h3>
    <p class="lead">Recall that Blues have two sides where it can accept donations. So far we've seen this used to make a variable the subject of a sentence when a Red touches the <em>bottom</em> edge of the Blue.</p>

    <figure class="trilangle-gloss">
      <div class="trilangle">
        <trilangle-sentence>
          <template>
            [
              {"word": "sleep", "color": "blue", "dot": 0, "triangles": [[0,0,1]]},
              {"word": "cat", "color": "red", "triangles": [[0,1,0]]}
            ]
          </template>
        </trilangle-sentence>
      </div>
      <div>
        <dl>
          <dt>Idiomatic translation</dt>
          <dd>A cat is sleeping.</dd>

          <dt>Literal translation</dt>
          <dd>
            There exists a thing x and an event e,<br/>
            such that x is a cat,<br/>
            and e is of x sleeping.
          </dd>

          <dt>Formal semantics</dt>
          <dd>∃x ∃e cat(x) & sleep(e, x)</dd>
        </dl>
      </div>
    </figure>

    <p class="lead">This is because the Red donates is variable on all sides, and is attached to the Blue on an edge where the Blue can accept donations.</p>

    <h3>Subjects and objects</h3>
    <p class="lead">The two inputs to the Blue are actually slightly different from each other― whatever the <strong>bottom</strong> edge receives becomes the subject of its predicate, and whatever the <strong>right</strong> edge receives becomes the object.</p>

    <figure class="text-center">
      <img src="/assets/images/blue-arrow-labels.svg" class="px-3">
    </figure>

    <p class="lead">Given this, we can now talk about events involving multiple entities by using both edges.</p>

    <figure class="trilangle-gloss">
      <div class="trilangle">
        <trilangle-sentence>
          <template>
            [
              {"word": "monkey", "color": "red", "triangles": [[0,1,0]]},
              {"word": "see", "color": "blue", "dot": 0, "triangles": [[0,0,1]]},
              {"word": "action", "color": "red", "triangles": [[1,0,0]]}
            ]
          </template>
        </trilangle-sentence>
      </div>
      <div>
        <dl>
          <dt>Idiomatic translation</dt>
          <dd><a href="/assets/images/monkey-sees-action.jpg">Monkey sees action.</a></dd>

          <dt>Literal translation</dt>
          <dd>
            There exists things x and y, and an event e,<br>
            such that x is a monkey,<br>
            y is an action,<br>
            and e is an event of x seeing y.
          </dd>

          <dt>Formal semantics</dt>
          <dd>∃x ∃y ∃e monkey(x) & action(y) & see(e, x, y)</dd>
        </dl>
      </div>
    </figure>

    <p>In the figure above, the event <i>see</i> takes its subject, <i>monkey</i>, from its bottom <em>and</em> it takes its object, <em>action</em>, from its right. Similarly, the formal semantic representation has a final third argument, y, which is the object.</p>

    <h3>Passive constructions</h3>
    <p class="lead">You can make a passive sentence <span class="text-muted">(e.g. "a banana is eaten")</span> by omitting the triangle in the subject position of a Blue.</p>

    <figure class="trilangle-gloss">
      <div class="trilangle">
        <trilangle-sentence>
          <template>
            [
              {"word": "eat", "color": "blue", "dot": 0, "triangles": [[0,0,1]]},
              {"word": "banana", "color": "red", "triangles": [[1,0,0]]}
            ]
          </template>
        </trilangle-sentence>
      </div>
      <div>
        <dl>
          <dt>Idiomatic translation</dt>
          <dd>A banana is being eaten.</dd>

          <dt>Literal translation</dt>
          <dd>
            There exists a thing x and an event e,<br/>
            such that x is a banana,<br/>
            and e is of ⬚ eating x.
          </dd>

          <dt>Formal semantics</dt>
          <dd>∃x ∃e banana(x) & eat(e, ⬚, x)</dd>
        </dl>
      </div>
    </figure>

    <p>Note that in the formal representation, since the second argument of a predicate involving an event is always the subject, we have to explicitly state that the subject is undefined with a blank space (⬚).</p>

  <section>
    <h3>Adverbial modification</h3>
    <p class="lead">The event variable from a Blue can be used as an argument of another Blue to do adverb-like modification.</p>

    <figure class="trilangle-gloss">
      <div class="trilangle">
        <trilangle-sentence>
          <template>
            [
              {"word":"quick","color":"blue","level":0,"dot":0,"triangles":[[0,0,1]]},
              {"word":"run","color":"blue","level":0,"triangles":[[0,1,0]],"dot":2},
              {"word":"mouse","color":"red","level":0,"triangles":[[-1,1,1]],"dot":2}
            ]
          </template>
        </trilangle-sentence>
      </div>
      <div>
        <dl>
          <dt>Idiomatic translation</dt>
          <dd>A mouse runs quickly.</dd>

          <dt>Literal translation</dt>
          <dd>
            There exists a thing x and events e and f,<br/>
            such that x is a mouse,<br/>
            and e is of x running,<br/>
            and f is of e being quick.
          </dd>

          <dt>Formal semantics</dt>
          <dd>∃x ∃e ∃f mouse(x) & run(e, x) & quick(f, e)</dd>
        </dl>
      </div>
    </figure>

    <p class="lead">Using Blues like <i>in, to,</i> and <i>with</i>, you can represent sentences that would otherwise be represented as ditransitives in other languages.</p>

    <figure class="trilangle-gloss">
      <div class="trilangle">
        <trilangle-sentence>
          <template>
            [{"word":"to","color":"blue","level":0,"dot":0,"triangles":[[0,0,1]]},{"word":"give","color":"blue","level":0,"triangles":[[0,1,0]],"dot":2},{"word":"Santa","color":"red","level":0,"triangles":[[-1,1,1]],"dot":2},{"word":"child","color":"red","level":0,"triangles":[[1,0,0]],"dot":2},{"word":"present","color":"red","level":0,"triangles":[[0,1,1]],"dot":2}]
          </template>
        </trilangle-sentence>
      </div>
      <div>
        <dl>
          <dt>Idiomatic translation</dt>
          <dd>Santa gives a child a present.</dd>

          <dt>Literal translation</dt>
          <dd>
            There exists things x, y, and z, and events e and f,<br/>
            such that x is Santa,<br/>
            y is a child,<br/>
            z is a present,<br/>
            and e is of x giving z,<br/>
            and f is of e being to y.
          </dd>

          <dt>Formal semantics</dt>
          <dd>∃x ∃y ∃z ∃e ∃f Santa(x) & child(y) & present(z) & give(e, x, z) & to(f, e, y)</dd>
        </dl>
